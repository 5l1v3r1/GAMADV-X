** Consistency/Usability ***
These changes make arguments across similar commands consistent or make a command more usable.

00) Clean up argument parsing, give user location of error in command line.
Currently:
    ./gam.py update user testuser1 address type foo formatted '123 main street' primary
    ERROR: wrong type should be custom, home, other or work. Got foo
Proposed:
    ./gam.py update user testuser1 address type foo formatted '123 main street' primary

    Command: ./gam.py update user testuser1 address type >>>foo<<< formatted '123 main street' primary
    ERROR: Invalid argument: expected <custom|home|other|work>
    Help: Documentation is at https://github.com/jay0lee/GAM/wiki
This change involves creating functions like getBoolean, getChoice, getInteger, that standardize argument
processing. Additionally, common processing of large argument lists is combined into a function.
For example, doCreateuser and doUpdateUser call getuserAttributes rather than repeating the argument processing.

01) Make reminder argument consistent in add/update calendar and calendar addevent.
Currently:
    gam <UserTypeEntity> add/update calendar take reminder <Method> <Minutes>
    gam calendar <EmailAddress> addevent takes reminder <Minutes> <Method>
Proposed:
Allow either order for all commands.

02) Make the file selection arguments for all drivefile and drivefileacl commands consistent.
    <DriveFileEntity> ::= ([id] <DriveFileItem>)|(ids <DriveFileList>|<FileSelector>|<ArgsSelector>|<CSVkmdSelector>|<CSVDataSelector>)|(drivefilename[:| ]<DriveFileName>)|(query[:| ]<QueryDriveFile>)|root
    
04) Corrected gam create resource so that type argument is properly recognized.

05) Add type specification argument for gam print resources.
    gam print resources [todrive] [allfields] [id] [description] [email] [type]

06) Make the gam whatis command work better. Add an argument to suppress all output beyond the statement
indicating the type of the email address.
    gam whatis <EmailAddress> [noinfo]
If noinfo is specified, doGetUserInfo, doGetGroupInfo, doGetAliasInfo are not called.
If noinfo is not specified, the arguments in the doGetxxxInfo functions are processed starting at the correct point.
Additionally, each of the doGetxxxInfo functions silently ignore non-relevant arguments.
    gam whatis foo@bar.com nousers nogroups
If foo@bar.com is a user, nogroups takes effect and nousers is ignored.
If foo@bar.com is a group, nousers takes effect and nogroups is ignored.
If foo@bar.com is an alias, all arguments are ignored. 

07) All "Getting ...", "Retrieving ...", "Got ..." messages are now written to stderr.
Most already were but the following commands wrote to stdout:
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show gmailprofile
    gam <UserTypeEntity> deprov
    gam <UserTypeEntity> delete label
    gam <UserTypeEntity> transfer drive
    gam <UserTypeEntity> add drivefile
    gam <UserTypeEntity> update drivefile
    gam <UserTypeEntity> delete drivefile
    gam <UserTypeEntity> get drivefile

*** Minor Enhancements ***
These changes add basic new new functionality.

01) Allow gam batch to read lines from stdin by specifying - instead of a file name.
    cat foo.bat | gam batch -
This makes gam batch have the same file options as gam csv; for those heavy duty scripting users.

02) Two new mutually exclusive arguments are defined for gam print mobile to set the amount of data retrieved.
    bam print mobile basic|full

03) A new argument (delimiter <String>) is defined in gam print users.
It is used when the groups argument is specified, <String> rather than a single space will separate the entries in the groups list.
    gam print users delimiter ',' groups

04) A new argument (delimiter <String>) is defined in gam print courses.
It is used when the aliases argument is specified, <String> rather than a single space will separate the entries in the aliases list.
    gam print courses delimiter ',' aliases

05) Extend gam version to force an update check.
    gam version check

06) Get information about a specific calendar.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> info calendar <EmailAddress>

07) Support event notification property in calendars.
In gam <UserTypeEntity> add calendar and gam <UserTypeEntity> update calendar, add notification argument; it may be repeated.
   notification email|sms event_creation|event_change|event_cancellation|event_response|agenda
   gam user foo@bar.com update calendar bar.com_dsoevca1qm34unsejmac3tsbv4@group.calendar.google.com notification email event_creation notification sms event_change

08) Add an argument to gam <UserTypeEntity> show signature to format the signature.
   gam <UserTypeEntity> show signature [format]

09) Add argument to gam print printjobs and gam printjob fetch to control number of retrieved print jobs.
   gam print printjobs ... limit <Number>
   gam printjob <PrinterId> fetch ... limit <Number>
limit specifies the maximum number of print jobs to retrieve; defaults to 25, set limit to 0 to retrieve all print jobs.

*** Enhancements ***
These enhancements add more substantial functionality.

01) Allow user properties that are arrays, e.g., phone, organization, address, to be cleared.
Gam can currently set these arrays but has no way of removing all of the entries.
    gam update user <UserID> <Property> clear|none
<Property> is phone, organization, im, address, ...
    gam update user foo@bar.com phone none

02) Support user properties website and note.
In gam create user and gam update user add website argument.
    website home_page|blog|profile|work|home|other|ftp|reservations|app_install_page|<String> <Value>
    gam update user foo@bar.com website work www.bar.com
If <String> is specified instead of one of the pre-defined values, it will be marked custom.

    note text_plain|text_html file <FileName>
    note text_plain|text_html <String>
    gam update user foo@bar.com note text_plain "Works weekend shift"

03) The format argument in gam get drivefile is extended to offer more choices of file types and can be a list.
The possible formats are: csv|html|txt|tsv|jpeg|jpg|png|svg|pdf|rtf|pptx|xlsx|docx|odt|ods|openoffice|ms|microsoft|micro$oft
ms, microsoft and micro$oft are  shorthand for docx,pptx,xlsx
openoffice is shorthand for odt,ods
    gam get drivefile drivefilename <DriveFileEntity> format docx,rtf,txt,odt,pdf
This will get file XXX as long as it is in some text document format. If a file is available in multiple formats, the first
available format in the list is chosen.

04) Add a command to remove drive files from the trash.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> untrash drivefile <DriveFileEntity>

05) Extend gam update group to explicitly allow clearing members from a group.
    gam update group <GroupItem> clear [owner] [manager] [member]

06) Extend the gam course add and gam course remove commands to use the same participant selections as gam course sync.
    gam course <CourseID> add teachers|students <UserTypeEntity>
    gam course <CourseID> delete teachers|students <UserTypeEntity>
    gam course <CourseID> sync teachers|students <UserTypeEntity>
<UserTypeEntity> ::=
	<EmailAddress>|
	(all users)|
	(user <EmailAddress>)|
	(users <EmailAddressList>)|
	(group <EmailAddress)|
	(ou <OrgUnitPath)|
	(ou_and_children <OrgUnitPath)|
	(courseparticipants <CourseID>)|
	(students <CourseID>)|
	(teachers <CourseID>)|
	(file <FileName> [charset <Charset>])|
	(csvfile <FileName>:<FieldName> [charset <Charset>])|
	(query <Query>)|
	(groups <GroupList)|
	(ous|orgs <OrgUnitList)|
	(ous_and_children|ous_and_child <OrgUnitList)|
	(courseparticipants <CourseIDList>)|
	(students <CourseIDList>)|
	(teachers <CourseIDList>)|
	(args users|groups|ous|ous_and_children|courseparticipants|students|teachers <Marker> <UserItem>* <Marker>)|
	(datafile users|groups|ous|ous_and_children|courseparticipants|students|teachers <FileName> [charset <Charset>])|
	(csvkmd users|groups|ous|ous_and_children|courseparticipants|students|teachers <FileName> [charset <Charset>]
		keyfield <FieldName> [delimiter <String>]
		[matchfield <FieldName> <PythonRegularExpression>]
		[datafield <FieldName> [delimiter <String>]])|
	(csvdata <FieldName>)

07) Add a command to support updating a list of ChromeOS devices.
Currently:
    gam update cros <DeviceID>|query:<Query> <CrOSAttributes>
    gam all cros update <CrOSAttributes>
Proposed:
    gam cros <DeviceIDList> update <CrOSAttributes>

08) Implement pull request #93 to be able to mark messages as spam.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> spam message|messages query <Query> [doit] [max_to_move <Number>]
<Number> defaults to 1.

09) Modify show filelist to allow arbitrary queries. The query <Query> argument always includes "'me' in owners" which limits the scope.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show filelist ... fullquery <Query> ...

10) Support user calendar creation/modification/deletion.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> create calendar summary <String> [description <String>] [location <String>] [timezone <String>]
    gam <UserTypeEntity> modify calendar <EmailAddress>|primary [summary <String>] [description <String>] [location <String>] [timezone <String>]
    gam <UserTypeEntity> remove calendar <EmailAddress>
Summary <string> is required when creating a calendar.
Primary refers to the user's primary calendar, it is replaced with the user's email address.

11) Process a csv file without subprocesses. The syntax is exactly the same as gam csv, but, rather than starting
a subprocess for each line, gam executes the command directly. There is no subprocess creation overhead, cleaner output,
but it will not execute as fast on large csv files as there is no parallelism.
    gam loop <Filename>|- gam ...

12) Improve support for languages with accented characters.
The following commands have been extended to allow specification of the character set used in the file.
    gam batch <Filename>|- [charset <Charset>]
    gam csv <Filename>|- [charset <Charset>] gam ...
    gam loop <Filename>|- [charset <Charset>] gam ...
<Charset> defaults to ascii; other typical values are: utf-8, utf-16, latin-1.

13) Extend gam csv/loop to select rows from a csv file by matching a field value.
    gam csv <Filename>|- [charset <Charset>] [matchfield <FieldName> <PythonRegularExpression>] gam ...
    gam loop <Filename>|- [charset <Charset>] [matchfield <FieldName> <PythonRegularExpression>] gam ...
<FieldName> does not have a leading ~ and must be a column heading in <FileName>.
For documentation on <PythonRegularExpression> see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html
    gam csv DeptGroups.csv matchfield Department Sales gam print group-members group ~Group
DeptGroups.csv:
Department,Group
Sales,sales-ny@bar.com
Sales,sales-nj@bar.com
Marketing,mktg-ny@bar.com
Marketing,mktg-nj@bar.com

14) Extend gam csv/loop to allow field substitution within an argument.
    gam csv <Filename>|- [charset <Charset>] [matchfield <FieldName> <PythonRegularExpression>] [fieldsub] gam ...
    gam loop <Filename>|- [charset <Charset>] [matchfield <FieldName> <PythonRegularExpression>] [fieldsub] gam ...
If fieldsub is specified, you can have arguments made of text combined with CSV fields; ~<FieldName>~ will be
replaced with the data in column <FieldName> of the CSV file.
    gam csv Users.csv fieldsub gam update user ~User note text-plain 'Full Name: ~First~ ~Last~'

15) Reorganize gam so that it is importable on Mac OS/Linux.
This isn't elegant but it's a start; you can say:
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import os, sys, shlex
    from gam import ProcessGAMCommand
    # Set appropriate values
    os.environ['GAM_CFG_HOME'] = '/Users/admin/GAM'
    GAM_STDOUT = '/tmp/gamstdout.out'
    # Choose how to produce args list
    rc = ProcessGAMCommand(shlex.split('/Users/admin/GAM/gam.py redirect stdout write {0} info user admin'.format(GAM_STDOUT)))
    #rc = ProcessGAMCommand(['/Users/admin/GAM/gam.py',
    #                        'redirect', 'stdout, GAM_STDOUT,
    #                        'info', 'user', 'admin'])
    print 'GAM returned {0}'.format(rc)
    with open(GAM_STDOUT, 'rU') as f:
        for line in f:
            # Process outout
            print line.strip()

16) Add idfirst argument to all commands that write a CSV file to force column containing the object ID/name to be the leftmost column.

17) Add recursive argument to gam print group-members to show users from sub-groups rather than the sub-group name itself.
Two new columns indicate the sub-group that a user comes from and the depth of the sub-group.
The noduplicates argument ensures that a user only appears once in the list.

18) Modify gam <UserTypeEntity> show calendars command to allow output to CSV file.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show calendars [csv] [todrive]

19) Implement Pull request #10 to allow copying of Drive folders
    gam <UserTypeEntity> copy drivefile <DriveFileEntity> [newfilename <DriveFileName>] [recursive] [parentid <DriveFolderID>] [parentname <FolderName>]

20) Implement a command for redirecting stdout, stderr and CSV files.
    gam [redirect csv {{Section}}|<FileName> [append] [charset <CharSet>]] [redirect stdout {{Section}}|<FileName> [append]] [rerirect stderr {{Section}}|<FileName> [append]] ...
The redirect arguments must appear before any other gam arguments.
If <FileName> is relative, it will be stored in ~/Downloads.

21) Modify gam update group <GroupItem> add/sync to allow suspended users to be excluded from being added to the group.
    gam update group <GroupItem> add [owner|manager|member] [notsuspended] <UserTypeEntity>
    gam update group <GroupItem> sync [owner|manager|member] [notsuspended] <UserTypeEntity>
This option is effective for the following values of <UserTypeEntity>:
    all users | ou|org <OrgUnitPath | ou_and_children|ou_and_child <OrgUnitPath> | query <Query>

22) Modify gam course <CourseID> add/sync to disallow suspended users from being added to the course.
    gam course <CourseID> add teachers|students <UserTypeEntity>
    gam course <CourseID> sync teachers|students <UserTypeEntity>
This option is effective for the following values of <UserTypeEntity>:
    all users | ou|org <OrgUnitPath | ou_and_children|ou_and_child <OrgUnitPath> | query <Query>

23) Add a command to show the file path of a Google Drive file.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show filepath <DriveFileEntity>

24) Add filepath argument to gam show fileinfo to show the file path of a Google Drive file.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show fileinfo <DriveFileEntity> [filepath] [allfields|<DriveFieldName>*]

25) Add filepath argument to gam show filelist to show the file path of Google Drive files.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show filelist ... [filepath] ...
Getting the file path for many files is expensive, use sparingly.

26) Add show argument to gam print course-participants to select what members to display; the default is all.
    gam print course-participants ... [show all|students|teachers]

27) Add untrash argument to gam delete drivefile to remove file from trash.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> delete drivefile <DriveFileEntity> [purge|untrash]

28) Add arguments to gam info group to suppress aliases listing and include groups of which this group is a member.
    gam info group <Group> ... [noaliases] [groups]

29) Add listlimit argument to gam print cros to limit number of timeranges and recentusers entries
    gam print cros ... [listlimit <Number>]

30) Added command to untrash messages
    gam <UserTypeEntity> untrash messages query <Query> [doit] [max_to_untrash <Number>]

31) Add fields argument to gam info user to allow selection of fields.
    gam info user [<User>] [noaliases] [nogroups] [nolicenses] [noschemas] [schemas <SchemaNameList>] [userview] [fields <UserFieldNamesList>]

32) Add fields argument to gam print users to allow expanded selection of fields.
    gam print users [todrive] ([domain <DomainName>] [query <Query>] [deleted_only|only_deleted])|[select <UserTypeEntity>]
	[delimiter <String>] [groups] [license|licenses] [emailpart|emailparts|username]
	[orderby familyname|lastname|givenname|firstname|email] [ascending|descending] [userview]
	[allfields | <UserFieldNames>* | fields <UserFieldNamesList>]

33) Add fields argument to gam info group to allow selection of fields.
    gam info group <Group> [nousers] [noaliases] [groups] [fields <GroupFieldNamesList>|<GroupSettingsFieldNamesList>]

34) Add fields argument to gam print groups to allow expanded selection of fields.
    gam print groups [todrive] ([domain <DomainName>] [member <UserItem>])|[select <GroupEntity>]
	[maxresults <Number>] [delimiter <String>]
	[members] [owners] [managers] <GroupFieldNames>* [settings] [fields <GroupFieldNamesList>|<GroupSettingsFieldNamesList>]

35) Add fields argument to gam info cros to allow selection of fields.
    gam info cros <CrOSDeviceID> [fields <CrOSFieldNamesList>]

36) Add fields argument to gam print cros to allow selection of fields.
    gam print cros [todrive] [query <Query>] [basic|full] [nolists|recentusers|timeranges] [listlimit <Number>]
	[orderby lastsync|location|notes|serialnumber|status|supportenddate|user] [ascending|descending] [fields <CrOSFieldNamesList>]

37) Jay added command to modify message labels.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> modify message|messages query <Query> (addlabel <LabelName>)* (removelabel <LabelName>)* [doit] [max_to_modify <Number>]

38) Added matchlabel argument to gam delete/modify/spam/trash/untrash messages as an additional way of selecting messages.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> delete message|messages query <Query> (matchlabel <LabelName>)* [doit] [max_to_delete <Number>]
    gam <UserTypeEntity> modify message|messages query <Query> (matchlabel <LabelName>)* (addlabel <LabelName>)* (removelabel <LabelName>)* [doit] [max_to_modify <Number>]
    gam <UserTypeEntity> spam message|messages query <Query> (matchlabel <LabelName>)* [doit] [max_to_modify <Number>]
    gam <UserTypeEntity> trash message|messages query <Query> (matchlabel <LabelName>)* [doit] [max_to_trash <Number>]
    gam <UserTypeEntity> untrash message|messages query <Query> (matchlabel <LabelName>)* [doit] [max_to_untrash <Number>]
A message must have all of the specified matchlabels to be selected.

39) Added charset argument to gam signature/vacation to allow specification of character set of file argument.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> signature|sig <String>|(file <FileName> [charset <Charset>]
    gam <UserTypeEntity> vacation <Boolean> [subject <String>] [message <String>]|[file <FileName> [charset <Charset>]] [contactsonly] [domainonly] [startdate <Date>] [enddate <Date>]

40) Added clear option to reminder and notification arguments of add/update calendar
    reminder clear|(email|sms|pop <Number>)
    notification clear|(email|sms eventcreation|eventchange|eventcancellation|eventresponse|agenda)

41) Add select argument to gam print users to allow selection of source of users.
    gam print users [todrive] ([domain <DomainName>] [query <Query>] [deleted_only|only_deleted])|[select <UserTypeEntity>]
	[delimiter <String>] [groups] [license|licenses] [emailpart|emailparts|username]
	[orderby familyname|lastname|givenname|firstname|email] [ascending|descending] [userview]
	[allfields | <UserFieldNames>* | fields <UserFieldNamesList>]

42) Add select argument to gam print groups/group-members to allow selection of groups.
    gam print groups [todrive] ([domain <DomainName>] [member <UserItem>])|[select <GroupEntity>]
	[maxresults <Number>] [delimiter <String>]
	[members] [owners] [managers] <GroupFieldNames>* [settings] [fields <GroupFieldNamesList>|<GroupSettingsFieldNamesList>]
    gam print group-members|groups-members [todrive] [recursive [noduplicates]] [group <GroupItem>]|[select <GroupEntity>]

43) Add select argument to gam report to allow selection of users. Add maxresults and nodatechange arguments.
    gam report users|user [todrive] [nodatechange] [maxresults <Number>]
	[date <Date>] [(user all|<UserItem>)|(select <UserTypeEntity>)] [filter|filters <String>] [fields|parameters <String>]
    gam report customers|customer|domain [todrive] [nodatechange]
	[date <Date>] [fields|parameters <String>]
    gam report admin|calendar|calendars|drive|docs|doc|groups|group|logins|login|mobile|tokens|token [todrive] [maxresults <Number>]
	[start <Time>] [end <Time>] [(user all|<UserItem>)|(select <UserTypeEntity>)] [event <String>] [filter|filters <String>] [ip <String>]
If nodatechange is specified, <Date> will not be moved back to the last acceptable date.
The maxResults argument, range 1-1000,  controls how many results are obtained in each packet from Google; it does not limit the total number of results.

44) Removed language, name, admin_secondary_email, mx_verify, user_migrations, outbound_gateway, email_route from gam update instance
language, name and admin_secondary_email are present in gam update customer
    gam update customer [primary <DomainName>] [adminsecondaryemail|alternateemail <EmailAddress>] [language <LanguageCode] [phone|phonenumber <String>]
	[contact|contactname <String>] [name|organizationname <String>]
	[address1|addressline1 <String>]  [address2|addressline2 <String>]  [address3|addressline3 <String>]
	[locality <String>] [region <String>] [postalcode <String>] [country|countrycode <String>]

45) Add membernames argument to gam print group-members to include member name (in addition to member email) in output. Add fields argument to allow full specification of fields.
    gam print group-members|groups-members [todrive] [membernames] [fields <MembersFieldNameList>] [recursive [noduplicates]] [group <GroupItem>]|[select <GroupEntity>]

46) Update gam <UserTypeEntity> delete groups to allow specification of a list of groups from which the users are to be deleted.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> delete|del group|groups [<GroupEntity>]

47) Add command to allow adding users to multiple groups.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> add group|groups [owner|manager|member] <GroupEntity>

48) Added skus <SKUIDList> argument to gam info user <User> so that licenses for desired SKUs can be shown.
    gam info user [<UserItem>] [noaliases] [nogroups] [nolicenses] [noschemas] [schemas <SchemaNameList>] [userview] [fields <UserFieldNamesList>] [skus|sku <SKUIDList>]

49) Added revision argument to gam <UserTypeEntity> get drivefile to allow downloading specific version of a file.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> get drivefile <DriveFileEntity> [format <FileFormatList>] [targetfolder <FilePath>] [revision <Number>]
Submitted by Seth Stein

50) Added command to show revisions of a file.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show filerevisions <DriveFileEntity>
Submitted by Seth Stein

51) Added command to show Google+ profile.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show gplusprofile [todrive]

52) Warning messages are now written to stderr.
To capture all stdout and stderr ouput from a command in a single file, do: gam command > file 2>&1

4.15.0

53) Added domain <DomainName> and member <UserItem> arguments to gam print group-members to allow selecting subsets of groups.
    gam print group-members|groups-members [todrive] ([domain <DomainName>] [member <UserItem>])|[group <GroupItem>]|[select <GroupEntity>] [membernames] [fields <MembersFieldNameList>] [recursive [noduplicates]]
These new arguments are the same as for gam print groups.

54) Add arguments to gam show fileinfo to allow field selection.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show fileinfo <DriveFileEntity> [filepath] [allfields|<DriveFieldNames>*]

55) Allow selection of CrOS devices by Organizational Unit.
    gam cros_ous <OrgUnitList> ...
    gam cros_ous_and_children <OrgUnitList> ..
The first form selects only the CrOS devices directly in the Org Units; the second form selects CrOS devices from the Org Units and all child Org Units.
Google does not support this selection directly in the API; gam has to download all CrOS devices and then perform the selection locally;
this could be time consumimg with very largs lists of CrOS devices.

56) Any place you can specify a Google Drive folder id, you can enter root to select the root folder.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show fileinfo root

57) Add arguments to gam show filetree to allow selection of starting folder and specification of output ordering.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show filetree [<DriveFileEntity>] [orderby <DriveOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]]*
If <DriveFileEntity> is omitted, the filetree output starts with the root folder.

58) Add arguments to gam show filelist to allow specification of output ordering.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show filelist [todrive] [query <Query>] [fullquery <Query>] [filepath] [allfields|<DriveFieldName>*] [orderby <DriveOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]]*

59) Processing of the arguments orderby <OrderByFieldName> and ascending|descending has been slightly restricted. Previously, these areguments
could appear in any order and they could be separated by other arguments; now, they must appear as: orderby <OrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]
gam show filelist/filetree allow specification of multiple orderby fields; all other commands allow specification of a single orderby field. 

60) The commands gam get drivefile, gam copy drivefile and gam update drivefile have been slightly restricted. Previously, these commands
allowed the <DriveFileEntity> to be specified anywhere in the list of arguments; now, <DriveFileEntity> must appear as the first argument after
the argument drivefile. This makes these commands consistent with gam delete drivefile and gam undelete drivefile.

4.16.0

61) The output of the command gam print contacts has been modified; the column heading User has been changed to Domain.
The output of the command gam <UserTypeEntity> print contacts has not changed.

4.16.4

62) Added commands to show messages/threads.
gam <UserTypeEntity> show message|messages (query <Query> (matchlabel <LabelName>)* [max_to_show <Number>] [includespamtrash])|(ids <MessageIDEntity>) [headers <String>] [showlabels]
gam <UserTypeEntity> show thread|threads (query <Query> (matchlabel <LabelName>)* [max_to_show <Number>] [includespamtrash])|(ids <MessageIDEntity>) [headers <String>] [showlabels]

4.16.5

63) Added argument to gam xxx messages/threads to allow id lists to be specified. In this case doit and max_to_xxx are not required.
gam <UserTypeEntity> delete message|messages (query <Query> (matchlabel <LabelName>)* [doit] [max_to_delete <Number>])|(ids <MessageIDEntity>)
gam <UserTypeEntity> modify message|messages (query <Query> (matchlabel <LabelName>)* [doit] [max_to_modify <Number>])|(ids <MessageIDEntity>) (addlabel <LabelName>)* (removelabel <LabelName>)*
gam <UserTypeEntity> spam message|messages (query <Query> (matchlabel <LabelName>)* [doit] [max_to_spam <Number>])|(ids <MessageIDEntity>)
gam <UserTypeEntity> trash message|messages (query <Query> (matchlabel <LabelName>)* [doit] [max_to_trash <Number>])|(ids <MessageIDEntity>)
gam <UserTypeEntity> untrash message|messages (query <Query> (matchlabel <LabelName>)* [doit] [max_to_untrash <Number>])|(ids <MessageIDEntity>)
gam <UserTypeEntity> show message|messages (query <Query> (matchlabel <LabelName>)* [max_to_show <Number>] [includespamtrash])|(ids <MessageIDEntity>)
gam <UserTypeEntity> show thread|threads (query <Query> (matchlabel <LabelName>)* [max_to_show <Number>] [includespamtrash])|(ids <MessageIDEntity>)

4.16.6

Credit to Steve Main for suggesting the following enhancement.
64) Added argument to gam <UserTypeEntity> signature and gam <UserTypeEntity> vacation to allow pattern substitution in the signature and vacation message.
gam <UserTypeEntity> signature <String>|(file <FileName> [charset <Charset>]) (replace <Tag> <String>)*
gam <UserTypeEntity> vacation <TrueValues> subject <String> (message <String>)|(file <FileName> [charset <CharSet>]) [contactsonly] [domainonly]
	[startdate <Date>] [enddate <Date>] (replace <Tag> <String>)*
Every instance of {<Tag>} in the signature/message will be replaced by <String>. Instances of the form {RT}...{Text}...{/RT} will be eliminated
if there was no <Tag> specified that matches Text or if a <Tag> matching Text was specified but the matching <String> is empty.
This is especially useful with CSV files.
gam csv Users.csv gam user '~User' signature file SignatureTemplate.txt replace 'User' '~User' replace 'Title' '~Title'

gam <UserTypeEntity> [add] filter [from <EmailAddress>] [to <EmailAddress>] [subject <String>] [haswords|query <List>] [nowords|negatedquery <List>] [musthaveattachment|hasattachment] [excludechats] [size larger|smaller <ByteCount>]
	[label <LabelID>] [important|notimportant] [star] [trash] [markread] [archive] [neverspam] [forward <EmailAddress>]
gam <UserTypeEntity> delete filters <FilterIDEntity>
gam <UserTypeEntity> show filters
gam <UserTypeEntity> info filters <FilterIDEntity>
gam <UserTypeEntity> print filters [todrive]

71) Add commands to process Gmail forwarding addresses.

gam <UserTypeEntity> show vacation [format]

76) The output of the command gam [<UserTypeEntity>] print contacts has been modified.
The first three column headings are User|Domain, ContactID, Name; the remaining column headings are sorted.
The column names for address, email, externalid, event, im, jot, organization, phone, relation, userdefinedfield and website have changed.
Using email as an example, if a user has two work email addresses and a home email address, the columns/values would have been:
Home Email,Home Email Primary,Work Email,Work Email Primary,Work Email 2,Work Email 2 Primary
home@domain.com,false,work1@domain.com,true,work2@domain.com,false
The new column headings are:
Emails.0.count,Emails.1.address,Emails.1.rank,Emails.1.type,Emails.2.address,Emails.2.rank,Emails.2.type,Emails.3.address,Emails.3.rank,Emails.3.type
3,home@domain.com,notprimary,home,work1@domain.com,primary,work,work2@domain.com,notprimary,work

The new headings should make processing the CSV file easier and allows gam csv to directly use the data from the CSV file.

77) Added command gam show contacts, it performs optional queries or shows all contacts.
gam show contacts [query <Query>] [updated_min yyyy-mm-dd]
	[basic|full] [showgroups] [showdeleted] [orderby <ContactOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]])
gam <UserTypeEntity> show contacts [query <Query>] [contactgroup <ContactGroupItem>] [updated_min yyyy-mm-dd]
	[basic|full] [showgroups] [showdeleted] [orderby <ContactOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]]

78) Modified command gam info contacts to operate only on contacts identified by their IDs.
gam info contacts <ContactEntity> [basic|full] [showgroups]
gam <UserTypeEntity> info contacts <ContactEntity> [basic|full] [showgroups]
If you have scripts that use the query or contactgroups arguments with gam info contacts, change info to show.

79) Added showgroups argument to gam info/print/show contacts to display output of contact group information.

80) Added emailmatchpattern <REPattern> and [emailmatchtype work|home|other|<String>] arguments to gam delete/print/show contacts
to allow matching on contact email addresses. emailmatchtype is only used when emailmatchpattern is specified.
Added fields argument to gam info/print/show contacts to allow selection of fields to display.
gam delete contacts <ContactEntity>|([query <Query>] [emailmatchpattern <REPattern>] [emailmatchtype work|home|other|<String>] [updated_min yyyy-mm-dd]
gam info contacts <ContactEntity> [basic|full] [showgroups] [fields <ContactFieldNameList>]
gam show contacts [query <Query>] [emailmatchpattern <REPattern>] [emailmatchtype work|home|other|<String>] [updated_min yyyy-mm-dd]
	[basic|full] [showgroups] [showdeleted] [orderby <ContactOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]] [fields <ContactFieldNameList>]
gam print contacts [todrive] [query <Query>] [emailmatchpattern <REPattern>] [emailmatchtype work|home|other|<String>] [updated_min yyyy-mm-dd]
	[basic|full] [showgroups] [showdeleted] [orderby <ContactOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]] [fields <ContactFieldNameList>]

gam <UserTypeEntity> delete contacts <ContactEntity>|([query <Query>] [contactgroup <ContactGroupItem>] [emailmatchpattern <REPattern>] [emailmatchtype work|home|other|<String>] [updated_min yyyy-mm-dd]
gam <UserTypeEntity> info contacts <ContactEntity> [basic|full] [showgroups] [fields <ContactFieldNameList>]
gam <UserTypeEntity> show contacts [query <Query>] [contactgroup <ContactGroupItem>] [emailmatchpattern <REPattern>] [emailmatchtype work|home|other|<String>] [updated_min yyyy-mm-dd]
	[basic|full] [showgroups] [showdeleted] [orderby <ContactOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]] [fields <ContactFieldNameList>]
gam <UserTypeEntity> print contacts [todrive] [query <Query>] [contactgroup <ContactGroupItem>] [emailmatchpattern <REPattern>] [emailmatchtype work|home|other|<String>] [updated_min yyyy-mm-dd]
	[basic|full] [showgroups] [showdeleted] [orderby <ContactOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]] [fields <ContactFieldNameList>]

81) Added command to show all of a user's contact groups.
gam <UserTypeEntity> show contactgroups [updated_min yyyy-mm-dd]
	[basic|full] [showdeleted] [orderby <ContactOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]]

82) Added command to print calendars to CSV file, dropped all arguments from gam show calendars.
gam <UserTypeEntity> print calendars [todrive]
gam <UserTypeEntity> show calendars

4.18.01

83) Added variable email_batch_size to gam.cfg, the default is 100 and the range is 1 to 100.
gam print/show messages/threads use this variable to batch retrieval of items from Gmail; it speeds up processing by a factor of ten.

4.18.02

84) Set exit/return code when no items are found to process in a command.
For example, if you want to test for the existance of a Google drive folder:
gam <UserTypeEntity> show fileinfo drivefilename 'Top Folder' and mimeType ='application/vnd.google-apps.folder'" id
The exit/return code is 0 if the folder exists, 60 if it doesn't.

4.18.03

85) Added command to print Gmail Profiles to CSV file, dropped all arguments from gam show gmailprofile.
gam <UserTypeEntity> print gmailprofile [todrive]
gam <UserTypeEntity> show gmailprofile

gam print schemas [todrive]
gam show schemas

88) Added command to print user access tokens to CSV file.
gam <UserTypeEntity> print tokens|token|3lo|oauth [todrive]

89) Added command to move a Google drive file to the trash.
gam <UserTypeEntity> trash drivefile <DriveFileEntity>
This is equivalent to: gam <UserTypeEntity> delete drivefile <DriveFileEntity> trash

90) Added command to remove a Google drive file from the trash.
gam <UserTypeEntity> untrash drivefile <DriveFileEntity>
This is equivalent to: gam <UserTypeEntity> delete drivefile <DriveFileEntity> untrash

91) Added commands to process threads in the same manner as messages.
Added and, or arguments to message processing commands. These arguments allow you to combine queries and matchlabels; the default conjunction is and.
Added quick and notquick arguments to message processing commands.
By default, gam delete/modify/spam/trash/untrash messages fetches all matching messages from Google and then processes only max_to_process of them.
To speed up fetching, specify quick and only max_to_process of the matching messages will be fetched. You must still specify doit to perform the operation.
By default, gam print/show messages fetch only max_to_process matching messages from Google and then processes them.
To see how many messages actually match, specify notquick and all matching messages will be fetched; only max_to_process of them will be processed.

gam <UserTypeEntity> delete messages|threads (((query <Query>) (matchlabel <LabelName>) [or|and])+ [quick|notquick] [doit] [max_to_delete|max_to_process <Number>])|(ids <MessageIDEntity>)
gam <UserTypeEntity> modify messages|threads (((query <Query>) (matchlabel <LabelName>) [or|and])+ [quick|notquick] [doit] [max_to_modify|max_to_process <Number>])|(ids <MessageIDEntity>) (addlabel <LabelName>)* (removelabel <LabelName>)*
gam <UserTypeEntity> spam messages|threads (((query <Query>) (matchlabel <LabelName>) [or|and])+ [quick|notquick] [doit] [max_to_spam|max_to_process <Number>])|(ids <MessageIDEntity>)
gam <UserTypeEntity> trash messages|threads (((query <Query>) (matchlabel <LabelName>) [or|and])+ [quick|notquick] [doit] [max_to_trash|max_to_process <Number>])|(ids <MessageIDEntity>)
gam <UserTypeEntity> untrash messages|threads (((query <Query>) (matchlabel <LabelName>) [or|and])+ [quick|notquick] [doit] [max_to_untrash|max_to_process <Number>])|(ids <MessageIDEntity>)
gam <UserTypeEntity> show messages|threads (((query <Query>) (matchlabel <LabelName>) [or|and])* [quick|notquick] [max_to_show|max_to_process <Number>] [includespamtrash])|(ids <MessageIDEntity>) [headers <String>] [showlabels] [showsize] [showsnippet]
gam <UserTypeEntity> print messages|threads (((query <Query>) (matchlabel <LabelName>) [or|and])* [quick|notquick] [max_to_print|max_to_process <Number>] [includespamtrash])|(ids <MessageIDEntity>) [headers <String>] [showlabels] [showsize] [showsnippet] [todrive]

92) All commands that process messages and threads now use the value of email_batch_size from gam.cfg to create batches to speed up processing.

93) Added select argument to gam print cros to allow selection of source of ChromeOS devices.
Add optional <UserTypeEntity> to gam print users and <CroSTypeEntity> to gam print cros.
gam [<CrOSTypeEntity>] print cros [todrive] [query <QueryCrOS>]|[select <CrOSTypeEntity>]
	[orderby <CrOSOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]] [nolists] [listlimit <Number>]
	[basic|full|allfields] <CrOSFieldName>* [fields <CrOSFieldNameList>]
gam [<UserTypeEntity>] print users [todrive] ([domain <DomainName>] [query <QueryUser>] [deleted_only|only_deleted])|[select <UserTypeEntity>]
	[delimiter <String>] [groups] [license|licenses|licence|licences] [emailpart|emailparts|username]
	[orderby <UserOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]] [userview]
	[basic|full|allfields | <UserFieldName>* | fields <UserFieldNameList>]

94) Added arguments to gam info cros to allow specification of desired output fields.
gam info cros <CrosDeviceEntity> [nolists] [listlimit <Number>]
	[basic|full|allfields] <CrOSFieldName>* [fields <CrOSFieldNameList>]
gam info croses <CrOSEntity> [nolists] [listlimit <Number>]
	[basic|full|allfields] <CrOSFieldName>* [fields <CrOSFieldNameList>]

95) Added drivedir and targetfolder <FilePath> arguments to gam printjob fetch and gam get photo to
allow specification of the destination folder for the file retrieved from Google. The default
location for these commands is the current working directory, drivedir specifies the value of drive_dir from gam.cfg and
targetfolder <FilePath> specifies a user-choosen path.
gam printjob|printjobs <PrinterID>|any fetch
	[olderthan|newerthan <PrintJobAge>] [query <QueryPrintJob>]
	[status <PrintJobStatus>]
	[orderby <PrintJobOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]]
	[owner|user <EmailAddress>]
	[limit <Number>] [drivedir|(targetfolder <FilePath>)]
gam <UserTypeEntity> get photo [drivedir|(targetfolder <FilePath>)]

4.18.05

96) The idfirst argument has been dropped from all print commands as its effect is now the default. Eliminate it from any scripts.

97) The command print is now a synonym for show for driveactivity, drivesettings, filelist.

98) The column headings for gam print org are now consistent regardless of what fields are chosen to display.
The headings are: Path, ID, Name, Description, Parent, ParentID, InheritanceBlocked

4.18.06

99) Added noshow argument to gam get photo to suppress displaying of photo data
gam <UserTypeEntity> get photo [drivedir|(targetfolder <FilePath>)] [noshow]

4.18.08

100) Added removeexpiration <Boolean> argument to gam update drivefileacl to allow removal of ACL expiration date.
gam <UserTypeEntity> update drivefileacl <DriveFileEntity> <PermissionID>
	(role <DriveFileACLRole>) [withlink] [removeexpiration <Boolean>] [transferownership <Boolean>] [showtitles]

101) Changed the CSV file headers for gam print delegates.
Old: User, delegateName, delegateAddress, delegationStatus
New: Delegator, Delegate, Delegate Email, Delegate ID, Status

4.19.00

102) At Jay Lee's suggestion, gam update schema was updated to function in a manner expected by users.
The existing schema is read, any <SchemaFieldDefinitions> that have the same field name as an existing field will update that field.
Any <SchemaFieldDefinitions> that don't exist in the current schema will be added.
You can delete fields; it is an error to delete a field that doesn't exist.
It is an error to delete all of the fields in a schema; delete the schema if it is no longer required.
The previous model that required that the entire field list be supplied on an update still works.
gam update schema <SchemaName> <SchemaFieldDefinition>* (deletefield <FieldName>)*
gam update schemas <SchemaEntity> <SchemaFieldDefinition>* (deletefield <FieldName>)*

103) Thanks to Jay Lee, classroom student guardians are now supported.
gam create guardian|guardianinvite|inviteguardian <EmailAddress> <UserItem>
gam delete guardian|guardians <GuardianID <UserItem>
gam show guardian|guardians [invitedguardian <GuardianID>] [student <UserItem>] [invitations] [states <GuardianStateList>] [<UserTypeEntity>]
gam print guardian|guardians [todrive] [invitedguardian <GuardianID>] [student <UserItem>] [invitations] [states <GuardianStateList>] [<UserTypeEntity>]

4.19.04

104) When specifying a flat file or CSV file as the source of a list of items, you can specify a delimiter so that multiple values can be
obtained from a single row of a flat file or a single column of a CSV file.
file <FileName> [charset <CharSet>] [delimiter <String>]
csvfile <FileName>:<FieldName> [charset <CharSet>] [delimiter <String>]
Suppose you have a program that queries a database to get the email addresses for all families at your school; there is one file per grade,
one row per family and multiple email addresses per row separated by spaces. For example, here is SecondGrade.txt
momfamily1@domain.com dadfamily1@domain.com
momfamily2@domain.com dadfamily2@domain.com
momfamily3@domain.com
...
The specification: file SecondGrade.txt delimiter ' '
would produce the list:
momfamily1@domain.com
dadfamily1@domain.com
momfamily2@domain.com
dadfamily2@domain.com
momfamily3@domain.com
...

4.19.05

105) Added products <ProductIDList> argument to gam info user <User> so that licenses for desired products can be shown.
You can specify products or skus but not both.
gam info user [<UserItem>] [noaliases] [nogroups] [nolicenses|nolicences] [noschemas] [schemas <SchemaNameList>] [userview] <UserFieldName>* [fields <UserFieldNameList>] [(products|product <ProductIDList>)|(skus|sku <SKUIDList>)]
	 
4.19.06

106) Expanded the options for parameter substitution in gam csv, RE pattern substitution is now available.
An argument containing instances of ~~xxx~!~pattern~!~replacement~~ has ~~...~~ replaced by re.sub(pattern, replacement, value of field xxx from the CSV file)
An argument containing instances of ~~xxx~~ has xxx replaced by the value of field xxx from the CSV file
An argument containing exactly ~xxx is replaced by the value of field xxx from the CSV file
For example, ~~primaryEmail~!~^(.+)@(.+)$~!~\1 AT \2~~ would replace foo@bar.com (from the primaryEmail column) with foo AT bar.com
